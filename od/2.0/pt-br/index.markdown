Versão 2.0

A *Open Definition* torna preciso o significado de "abrir" no que diz respeito ao conhecimento, promovendo um bem comum robusto no qual qualquer um pode participar, e a interoperabilidade é maximizada.

**Resumo:** *O conhecimento é aberto se qualquer um está livre para acessá-lo, usá-lo, modificá-lo, e compartilhá-lo — restrito, no máximo, a medidas que preservam a proveniência e abertura.*

Este significado essencial, corresponde ao de "abrir" no que diz respeito ao software como no [Open Source Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd) (Definição de Código Aberto) e é sinônimo de "free" ou "livre" como na definição de [Free Cultural Works](http://freedomdefined.org) (Obras Culturais Livres). A *Open Definition* foi inicialmente derivada da Open Source Definition, que por sua vez foi derivado das [Debian Free Software Guidelines](http://www.debian.org/social_contract).

O termo **obra** será usado para denotar o item ou peça de conhecimento que está sendo transferido.

A termo **licença** refere-se às condições legais em que a obra é disponibilizada. Quando nenhuma licença for oferecida, deve ser interpretado como referindo-se às condições legais -padrão que regem a utilização da obra (por exemplo, copyright ou de domínio público).

## 1. Open Works

An open **work** must satisfy the following requirements in its distribution:

### 1.1 Open License

The **work** *must* be available under an open **license** (as defined in Section 2).
Any additional terms accompanying the work (such as a terms of use, or patents held by the licensor) *must not* 
contradict the terms of the license.

### 1.2 Access

The **work** shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable 
one-time reproduction cost, preferably downloadable via the Internet without charge.
Any additional information necessary for license compliance (such as names of 
contributors required for compliance with attribution requirements) *must* also 
accompany the work.

### 1.3 Open Format

The **work** *must* be provided in a convenient and modifiable form such
that there are no unnecessary technological obstacles to the performance of the
licensed rights. Specifically, data should be machine-readable, available in
bulk, and provided in an open format (i.e., a format with a freely available
published specification which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon
its use) or, at the very least, can be processed with at least one free/libre/open-source
software tool.

of contributors, rights holders, sponsors and creators as long as
any such prescriptions are not onerous.

#### 2.2.7 Non-aggression

The **license** *may* require modifiers to grant the public additional permissions (for example, patent licenses) as required for exercise of the rights allowed by the license. The license may also condition permissions on not aggressing against licensees with respect to exercising any allowed right (again, for example, patent litigation).
