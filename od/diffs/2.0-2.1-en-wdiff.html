Version <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-2.0-]</span> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+2.1+}</span>

The Open Definition makes precise the meaning of &quot;open&quot; with respect to knowledge, promoting a robust commons in which anyone may participate, and interoperability is maximized.

**Summary:** *Knowledge is open if anyone is free to access, use, modify, and share it â€” subject, at most, to measures that preserve provenance and openness.*

This essential meaning matches that of &quot;open&quot; with respect to software as in the [Open Source <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-Definition](https://opensource.org/docs/osd)-]</span> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Open_Source_Definition)+}</span> and is synonymous with &quot;free&quot; or &quot;libre&quot; as in the <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+[Free Software Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Free_Software_Definition) and+}</span> [Definition of Free Cultural <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-Works](http://freedomdefined.org). The Open Definition was initially derived from the Open Source Definition, which in turn was derived from the [Debian Free Software Guidelines](http://www.debian.org/social_contract).-]</span> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+Works](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definition_of_Free_Cultural_Works).+}</span>

The term **work** will be used to denote the item or piece of knowledge being transferred.

The term **license** refers to the legal conditions under which the work is
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-made available. Where no license has been offered-]</span> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+provided.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+The term **public domain** denotes the abscence of copyright and similar+}</span>
<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+restrictions, whether by default or waiver of all such conditions.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+The key words &quot;must&quot;, &quot;must not&quot;, &quot;should&quot;, and &quot;may&quot;+}</span>
<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+in+}</span> this <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-should-]</span> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+document are to+}</span> be interpreted as <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-referring to default legal conditions governing use of the work (for -]</span>
<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">[-example, copyright or public domain).-]</span> <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+described in+}</span>
<span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">{+[RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119).+}</span>
