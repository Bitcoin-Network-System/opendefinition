<span style="color:red;">[-# The Open Source Definition-]</span>

<span style="color:green;">{+Version 1.1+}</span>

## <span style="color:red;">[-Introduction-]</span>
[--]
<span style="color:red;">[-Open source doesn't just mean access-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+Terminology +}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+The term **knowledge** is taken to include:+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+  1. Content such as music, films, books+}</span>
<span style="color:green;">{+  2. Data be it scientific, historical, geographic or otherwise+}</span>
<span style="color:green;">{+  3. Government and other administrative information+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+Software is excluded despite its obvious centrality because it is already adequately addressed by previous work.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+The term **work** will be used+}</span> to <span style="color:green;">{+denote+}</span> the <span style="color:red;">[-source code.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+item or piece of knowledge which is being transferred.+}</span>

The <span style="color:red;">[-distribution terms-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+term **package** may also be used to denote a collection+}</span> of <span style="color:red;">[-open-source software must comply with-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+works. Of course such a package may be considered a work in itself.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+The term **license** refers to the legal license under which the work is made available. Where no license has been made this should be interpreted as referring to the resulting default legal conditions under which the work is available (for example copyright).+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+## The Definition +}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+A work is open if its manner of distribution satisfies+}</span> the following <span style="color:red;">[-criteria:-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+conditions:+}</span>

### 1. <span style="color:red;">[-Free-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+Access +}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+The work shall be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably downloading via the Internet without charge. The work must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: This can be summarized as 'social' openness - not only are you allowed to get the work but you can get it. 'As a whole' prevents the limitation of access by indirect means, for example by only allowing access to a few items of a database at a time (material should be available in bulk as necessary). Convenient and modifiable means that material should be machine readable (rather than, for example, just human readable).*+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+### 2.+}</span> Redistribution 

The license shall not restrict any party from selling or giving away the <span style="color:red;">[-software-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work either on its own or+}</span> as <span style="color:red;">[-a component-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+part+}</span> of <span style="color:red;">[-an aggregate software distribution containing programs-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+a package made+}</span> from <span style="color:red;">[-several-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+works from many+}</span> different sources. The license shall not require a royalty or other fee for such <span style="color:red;">[-sale.-]</span>
[--]
<span style="color:red;">[-### 2. Source Code-]</span>
[--]
<span style="color:red;">[-The program must include source code, and must allow distribution in source code as well as compiled form. Where some form of a product is not distributed with source code, there must be a well-publicized means of obtaining the source code for no more than a reasonable reproduction cost preferably, downloading via the Internet without charge. The source code must be the preferred form in which a programmer would modify the program. Deliberately obfuscated source code is not allowed. Intermediate forms such as the output of a preprocessor-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+sale+}</span> or <span style="color:red;">[-translator are not allowed.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+distribution.+}</span>

### 3. <span style="color:red;">[-Derived Works-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+Reuse+}</span> 

The license must allow <span style="color:green;">{+for+}</span> modifications and <span style="color:red;">[-derived works,-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+derivative works+}</span> and must allow them to be distributed under the <span style="color:red;">[-same-]</span> terms <span style="color:red;">[-as the license-]</span> of the original <span style="color:red;">[-software.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: Note that this clause does not prevent the use of 'viral' or share-alike licenses that require redistribution of modifications under the same terms as the original.*+}</span>

### 4. <span style="color:red;">[-Integrity-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+Absence+}</span> of <span style="color:green;">{+Technological Restriction+}</span> 

The <span style="color:red;">[-Author's Source Code-]</span>
[--]
<span style="color:red;">[-The license may restrict source-code from being distributed-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work must be provided+}</span> in <span style="color:red;">[-modified-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+such a+}</span> form <span style="color:red;">[-*only* if the license allows-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+that there are no technological obstacles to+}</span> the <span style="color:red;">[-distribution-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+performance+}</span> of <span style="color:red;">[-&quot;patch files&quot; with-]</span> the <span style="color:red;">[-source code for-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+above activities. This can be achieved by+}</span> the <span style="color:red;">[-purpose-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+provision+}</span> of <span style="color:red;">[-modifying-]</span> the <span style="color:red;">[-program at build time.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work in an open data format, i.e. one whose specification is publicly and freely available and which places no restrictions monetary or otherwise upon its use.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+### 5. Attribution+}</span> 

The license <span style="color:green;">{+may require as a condition for redistribution and re-use the attribution of the contributors and creators to the work. If this condition is imposed it+}</span> must <span style="color:red;">[-explicitly permit distribution-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+not be onerous. For example if attribution is required a list+}</span> of <span style="color:red;">[-software built from modified source code.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+those requiring attribution should accompany the work.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+### 6. Integrity+}</span> 

The license may require <span style="color:red;">[-derived works to-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+as a condition for the work being distributed in modified form that the resulting work+}</span> carry a different name or version number from the original <span style="color:red;">[-software.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work.+}</span>

### <span style="color:red;">[-5.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+7.+}</span> No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups 

The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.

<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: In order to get the maximum benefit from the process, the maximum diversity of persons and groups should be equally eligible to contribute to open knowledge. Therefore we forbid any open-knowledge license from locking anybody out of the process.*+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: this is taken directly from item 5 of the OSD.*+}</span>

### <span style="color:red;">[-6.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+8.+}</span> No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor 

The license must not restrict anyone from making use of the <span style="color:red;">[-program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> in a specific field of endeavor. For example, it may not restrict the <span style="color:red;">[-program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> from being used in a business, or from being used for genetic research.

<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: The major intention of this clause is to prohibit license traps that prevent open material from being used commercially. We want commercial users to join our community, not feel excluded from it.*+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: this is taken directly from item 6 of the OSD.*+}</span>

### <span style="color:red;">[-7.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+9.+}</span> Distribution of License 

The rights attached to the <span style="color:red;">[-program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> must apply to all to whom <span style="color:red;">[-the program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+it+}</span> is redistributed without the need for execution of an additional license by those parties.

<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: This clause is intended to forbid closing up knowledge by indirect means such as requiring a non-disclosure agreement.*+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: this is taken directly from item 7 of the OSD.*+}</span>

### <span style="color:red;">[-8.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+10.+}</span> License Must Not Be Specific to a <span style="color:red;">[-Product-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+Package+}</span> 

The rights attached to the <span style="color:red;">[-program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> must not depend on the <span style="color:red;">[-program's-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> being part of a particular <span style="color:red;">[-software distribution.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+package.+}</span> If the <span style="color:red;">[-program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> is extracted from that <span style="color:red;">[-distribution-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+package+}</span> and used or distributed within the terms of the <span style="color:red;">[-program's-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work's+}</span> license, all parties to whom the <span style="color:red;">[-program-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work+}</span> is redistributed should have the same rights as those that are granted in conjunction with the original <span style="color:red;">[-software distribution.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+package.+}</span>
{++}
<span style="color:green;">{+*Comment: this is taken directly from item 8 of the OSD.*+}</span>

### <span style="color:red;">[-9.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+11.+}</span> License Must Not Restrict <span style="color:green;">{+the Distribution of+}</span> Other <span style="color:red;">[-Software-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+Works+}</span> 

The license must not place restrictions on other <span style="color:red;">[-software-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+works+}</span> that <span style="color:red;">[-is-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+are+}</span> distributed along with the licensed <span style="color:red;">[-software.-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+work.+}</span> For example, the license must not insist that all other <span style="color:red;">[-programs-]</span> <span style="color:green;">{+works+}</span> distributed on the same medium <span style="color:red;">[-must be open-source software.-]</span>
