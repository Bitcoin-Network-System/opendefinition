# Agenda

  * OD 2.1 final draft
  * AOB
    * Open Definition Badges
  * Other Issues?


# Summary

  * Public domain: maybe some small clarification in the preamble
  * General
    * Discussions of principle vs pragmatic application.
      * e.g. raw source for everything vs pragmatism around e.g. video (requiring raw source for all of that)
    * Shared goal both of something powerful clear but also widely used and adopted - we care about this being practical for publishers and others.
  * 1.3 Machine Readability  
   _The work must be provided in a form readily processable by a computer and where the individual elements of the work can be easily accessed and modified._  
   Comment from Aaron: I feel uncomfortable with having zero written guidance about the interpretation of “individual elements”. What if we removed “individual”? seems excessive and redundant anyway…

  * 1.4 Open Format  
    _The work must be provided in an open format. An open format is one which places no restrictions, monetary or otherwise, upon its use and can be fully processed with at least one free/libre/open-source software tool. The work should be provided in the form preferred for making modifications to it._

  * 1.4 Machine Readability - old one  
    <s>_The work should be provided in "machine-readable" form, that is one in which the content can easily be accessed and processed by a computer, and which is in form in which modifications to individual data/content elements can easily be performed._</s>  
    The work must be provided in "machine-readable" form, that is one in which the content can easily be accessed and processed by a computer, and which is such that access and modification to individual data/content elements can easily be performed.  
    RP's wording: “…appropriate for working with and/or modifying the individual data or content elements.”
